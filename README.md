# baateinTheChatWebApp
Created a chat web app, using the Firebase platform. <br>
App features :
<ul>
<li>Syncs data using the Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage.
<li>Authenticate users using Firebase Google Auth. 
<li>Ability to attach and send images.
<li>Sends notifications when the web app is not in the foreground.
</ul>

Deployed the web app on Firebase static hosting. You can find the complete app at <br>https://friendlychat-70573.firebaseapp.com/

<h6>I took a lot of help from the resources available at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/ as this was my first Firebase project. </h6>
